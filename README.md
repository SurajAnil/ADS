Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contians solutions to numerous data structures and algorithms related problems.
All programs are written in C and C++.

Algrithms:
----------

An algorithm is a process which given an instance of a specific problem, produces a solution and exhibit the following characteristics:
	a. Should be clear to implement.
	b. Always produces a correct output.
	c. Takes a finite amount of time to arrive at a solution.

Complexity:
-----------

Complexity referes to the amount of resource consumed by an algorithm. It could be either
	a. Time or
	b. Space

Definition of O:
----------------
An efficiency class O(f(n)), for some specific complexity function f(n), is a set of functions that are
equivalent under the following three assumptions:

	1. we analyze for worst case complexity functions f(n) that form an upper bound, 
	so that any observed complexity g(n) obeys g(n) ≤ f(n);
	
	2. we disregard input sizes n smaller than some algorithm-specific threshold t; and
	
	3. we also disregard constant multiplicative factors in complexity functions; 
	in other words, we may replace c·f(n) with f(n) for any c > 0.


Note: This repository replaces the older deleted repo that covered many challenges. 
I had to wipe it all out as I wanted to start all over again.
